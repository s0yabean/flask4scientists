# From  http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/1.0.1/crash_course.html

#So youâ€™ve cracked your knuckles and started working on that 
#awesome python webapp you want to write. You get through writing
#a few pages and finally you need to tackle that loathsome task: 
#form input handling and validation. Enter WTForms.
#
#But why do I need yet another framework? Well, some webapp
#frameworks take the approach of associating database models 
#with form handling. While this can be handy for very basic 
#create/update views, chances are not every form you need 
#can map directly to a database model. Or maybe you already 
#use a generic form handling framework but you want to customize 
#the HTML generation of those form fields, and define your own 
#validation.
#
#With WTForms, your form field HTML can be generated for you, 
#but we let you customize it in your templates. This allows 
#you to maintain separation of code and presentation, and 
#keep those messy parameters out of your python code. Because 
#we strive for loose coupling, you should be able to do that 
#in any templating engine you like, as well.

from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from wtforms import Form, FloatField, validators

from compute import compute #my own function

app = Flask(__name__)

# Model
# From wtforms package
class InputForm(Form):
    r = FloatField(validators=[validators.InputRequired()])
    # the 2 validators here are for 2 purposes. The outside 
    # on is to validate that a number is provided by user, 
    # and the inner one is to prompt the user to must submit
    # an imput and not leave it blank.
    
# View
    
#Essentially, decorators work as wrappers, modifying the behavior
#of the code before and after a target function execution, without
#the need to modify the function itself, augmenting the original
#functionality, thus decorating it.
