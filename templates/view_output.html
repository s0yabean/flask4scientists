Hello, World! sin({{ form.r.data }}) = {{s}} 
</html>

<!-- "form.r.data" variables corresponds to the InputForm class 
under the "#Model" section in controller_flask.py. The curly
wrappers tells the html to go look at controller_flask.py
(where the template is rendered) and see where is the 
"form.r.data" or s variables.

* DO NOT USE THE CURLY BRACKETS IN MY COMMENTS AS JINJA2 (SYTHAX THAT 
HANDLES THE DATA TRASFERRING WILL PICK IT UP)
